### FEATURES AND HOW-TO'S

To minimize clutter, the spin function is activated when a player clicks anywhere within the spinner section, and along with the total score update, the amount accumulated or lost during the current spin are then rendered by playing sound and highlighting the corresponding text in a style reminiscent to token tip alerts recieved during live cam streams.

Like any other casino slot machine, the player may continue for as long as they like by coughing up sufficient funds, and certain combinations of images result in wins and losses of varrying amounts. But in the spirit of the game's theme, certain combinations will perform relevant actions, such as site logos taking a cut of the player's earnings the same way they do to their models.
