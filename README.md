## FEATURES AND HOW-TO'S

- All slot images were illustrated by the game's maker (Me)
- To minimize clutter of an extra button or display area, the spin function is activated when a player clicks anywhere within the spinner section, and the amount of tokens won or lost during the current spin are rendered by highlighting the corresponding text in yellow
- Like any other slot machine game, certain combinations of images result in wins/losses of varrying amounts
- The player can continue to play for as long as they like by inserting more money
