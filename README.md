A casino favorite presented with a minimalist design and theme drawn from combining parts of online sex work subculture with flash tattoo styling

## FEATURES AND HOW-TO'S

All slot images were illustrated by the game's maker (Me). To minimize clutter of an extra button or display area, the spin function is activated when a player clicks anywhere within the spinner section, the token total is updated, and the amount won or lost during the current spin are then rendered by highlighting the corresponding text in a style reminiscent to token tip alerts recieved during live cam streams.

Like any other slot machine, certain combinations of images result in wins and losses of varrying amounts. But in the spirit of the theme, combinations of site logos will take a percentage of the player's earnings and certain depictions will "f*ck over" the player. And like any casion game, the player may continue for as long as they like by coughing up sufficient funds.
